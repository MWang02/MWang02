**Hi, I'm Max!** 

I'm currently a sophomore at the University of California of Santa Cruz. While I got into CS very late, I'm a quick learner and my foundations are sound. 

I'm familiar in working the following languages
##
- c/c++
- java
- python
#
I'm currently working on: 
##
- [x] leetcode to brush up on stuff
- [x] small practice projects, soon to get into more fun stuff
- [ ] js/css/html
- [ ] front/back end
- [ ] Kubernetes/Docker

What's marked is what I'm focusing on at the moment

#
While things are a bit empty at the moment, I'll probably start to fill it up with small practice samples, and eventually larger projects.
